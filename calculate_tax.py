# You have been asked to write a simple program involving calculating income tax, and have been provided with this table of information from the Australian Tax Office website:

# A) Write either pseudocode or a flowchart (your choice) that illustrates the design of a function which receives an income as a parameter and returns the amount of tax, calculated using the information in the table above.

# B) Write Python code for a function named “calculate_tax()” which implements your design. The function must:
#    Accept an “income” parameter (assume that it is a float).
#    Calculate the appropriate amount of tax.
#    Return the amount of tax as a float, rounded to two decimal places.

# C) Write a program that does the following (and uses your function as needed):
#    Prompt the user to enter their old income and attempt to convert it to
#       a float (re-prompt the user for input until they enter a float).
#    Prompt the user to enter their new income and attempt to convert it to
#       a float (re-prompt the user for input until they enter a float).
#       Hint: Use exception handling and a loop to re-prompt until a float is entered.
#    Calculate and store the amount of tax for the old and new incomes.
#    If their new income is more than their old income, print messages saying how much more they now earn and how much more tax they must pay.
#    Otherwise, if their new income is less than their old income, print messages saying how much less they now earn and how much less tax they must pay.
